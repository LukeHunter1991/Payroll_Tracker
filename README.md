# <Payroll Tracker>

## Description

I created a simple webpage to track 3 points of data for employees - first name, last name, and salary. The webpage allows the addition of multiple employees and formats the salary as a currency. In the console there two additional functions, the average salary and a random winner picked from the employee array.

In building this project I learned a huge amount about javaScript, including understanding loops, methods, and functions. I was also exposed to, and recreated, formatting an integer as a currency.


## Installation
